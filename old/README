Blender Addon Dependencies

this little hack permits to add a new field to Blender addons informations : dependencies.

this field permits to define another Blender addon as a 'parent', meaning it uses part of the code of its parent to run.
the mod will prevent an addon to be enabled if its parent addon is not enabled, or has a lower version than required.
the mod will prevent an addon to be disabled if another script is currently enabled and uses its code.

this is purely informative : it only checks the existence of the dependencies field in bl_info in an addon.
an addon with this field will work in the a non-modded Blender release,
non-modded addon will work in Blender with this modification.

the goal is to allow more collaborative work and encourage addons programmers to think their work both as a whole and a possible reusable set of code in other contexts, by other addons (parametric meshes, tools..)
