this addon installs or registers nothing,  does not import any module, and
has no features by itself : it applies safely a patch (more exactly it 
safely replaces some files) in Blender that gives some more features to the
addon builtin mecanism :

  . add a light dependency feature between addons
  . improve multi-modules blender addon development
  . improve the addon register/unregister/reload processes
  . change a bit the user preferences / addon user interface
  . see README for more

the patch can be removed by disabling the addon.

  
Documentation :
